# Single Page Application

This is a project demo that uses Vanilla JS to build a Single Page Application.
Here I built a Currency Converter Application from scratch, without using a client-side JavaScript framework. 

To use this code do the following;

Download Zip File

npm install

npm install body-parser

npm i semantic-ui-calendar-react

Run npm start or node server.
